Your password is saved in plaintext in the .env file. This is not secure at all, however my user did not have access to an API key, so I had to do it all this way instead. 

This tool is created by me for my personal use, not endorsed by any other person or company.

Nothing fancy. Just one big async function with a few reb requests, but it saves time.
