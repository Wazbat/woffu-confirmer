Automate hour confirmation by running this script via a scheduler. No maintenance should be required

Your password is saved encrypted using your machineID in the .env file. This is not secure at all, but is better than plaintext. You should be using a unique password if you consider using this tool. 

This tool is created by me for my personal use, not endorsed by any other person or company.

Nothing fancy. Just one big async function with a few reb requests, but it saves time and can automate stuff.

Made with :heart:
